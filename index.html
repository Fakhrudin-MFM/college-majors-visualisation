                <h1>What is the best college major in the United States?</h1>
                Most people want a degree which will enable them to make a lot of money upon graduation. Here
                are all the available degrees, sorted by the median salary received by students upon graduation. 

                This graph gives us the ranking of each university major, based on the median salary. It gives us a rough
                sense of which majors have the highest pay, but it's somewhat hard to read. Let's take a more detailed
                journey through this data. Scroll down when you are ready!

                Here, we have clustered the majors based on the broader category, of which there are 16 in total. The size 
                of the bubbles represent the median salary. 

                When sorted like this, it's quite clear that engineering majors of all kinds have generally above-average median salaries.

                Now what if we took those same categories, but coloured them based on the proportion of the students which are male or female? 
                In this chart, blue represents majors with >50% male, and red represents >50% female

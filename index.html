                <h1>What is the best college major in the United States?</h1>
                Most people want a degree which will enable them to make a lot of money upon graduation. Here
                are (almost) all the available degrees, sorted by the median salary received by students upon graduation. 

                This graph gives us the ranking of each university major, based on the median salary of graduates. It gives us a rough
                sense of which majors have the highest pay, but it's somewhat hard to read. Let's take a more detailed
                journey through this data. Scroll down when you are ready! <br><br>

                If you ever want to find out more about a bubble, just hover over it and a tooltip should appear.<br><br>

                Here, we have clustered the majors based on the broader category, of which there are 16 in total. The size 
                of the bubbles represent the median salary of graduates from the major. 

                When sorted like this, it's quite clear that engineering majors of all kinds have generally above-average median salaries. <br><br>
                On the other end, it appears that majors in the field of psychology on average have the lowest graduate salaries. <br>

                Hello
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                Now what if we took those same categories, but coloured them based on the proportion of the students which are male or female? 
                In this chart, blue represents majors with > 60% male, and red represents > 60% female, and the grey bubbles represent the gender 
                balanced courses. (Hover over the labels if you've forgotten the category)
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                When we plot the % of students in a major being female against the median salary of students in the major, a fairly clear trend emerges. 
                It appears that majors with a high proportion of male students also produce students with higher median wages. <br><br> In fact, a linear model
                would predict that for every added percentage of female students in a given major, the median annual salary drops by $306 USD.

            <section class="step">
                So we've seen the most 'profitable' majors, as well as the ones with the most unevent gender distributions. But what are students 
                actually enrolling in the most frequently? What can enrolment numbers tell us about actual interest in each major?
